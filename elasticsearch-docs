Elastic Search:

Node- Instance of elastic search, any number of nodes can run in a single machine

Cluster- group of nodes of same instances

Document- Each unit of data stored in elastic search is called document, json object.

Documents can be equialent to tables in sql, fields can be equivalent to column in tables

Indices- Collections of documents with similar characteristics


Summary-1:
1) Node store data that we add to Elastic Search
2) A Cluster is a collection of nodes
3) Data is stored as documents which are jsonObjects
4) Documents are grouped together with indices

Inspect The Elastic Search Cluster:
1) Indices with prefix dot(.) indicates its a system indices
2) TLS is required when communicating with elastic user Https instead of http
3) For Local Deployments Specify either --insecure or --cacert
4) Requests must be authenticated use elastic user and auto-generated passwords
5) Specify Content-Type header when sending request body

Sharding & Scalability:
1) Sharding is a way to split index into smaller pieces each being a shard
2) Sharding helps to grow index in size, through put in size 
3) Consider a elastic with node size of 50Gb, now if you have a single index with 70GB it would be fit in a single index, not if you shard your index into 2 or multiple shards then each shard may present in different node.
4) Sharding makes it easier to fit larger index onto nodes
5) Default index has only 1 shard, can be configured while creating a index
6) Sharding helps in distributed query
7) Sharding enables us to scale the data volume. Adding more nodes to the cluster helps too, but only to a certain extent (unless there are no very large indices).
8) An index is divided into one or more shards, where each shard stores a part of the index' data.
9) An index will contain one shard for Elasticsearch >= 7.0.0.


Replication:
1) Hardware can fail at anytime so to keep your safe you need to replicate your data so that it can be fetched from other node
2) ElasticSearch supports replication by default
3) Replication is configured at index level
4) Replication works by creating a replica of shards that a index can contain, refered to as replicas or replica shards
5) A shard that has been replicated is called primary shard
6) A primary shard and its replica shards are called replication group
7) Replica shards are a complete copy of primary shards, which can serve search requests just like primary shards
8) The number of replica shards can be configured at index creation
9) Replica shards are never stored in same node as primary shard
10) Replication helps only if you have more than 1 node else no point in replication
11) Even tho replication is configured at index creation elastic is only going to replicate only there are more than 1 node
12) Replica shards of a replication group can server different requests simultaniously this increases the no of requests can be handled at the same time
13) Elasic intelligently routes requests to the best shards based on number of parameters
14) Assume you have 1 node elastic cluster and you have created a new index, then you can see immediately index and cluser state is changed to yellow because the default 1 replica shard is unassigned as there is only 1 node elastic wouldnt assign replica shard to the same node. Yellow state is a warning that data loss can happen if the node is lost or crashed as the replica shard is not assigned.
15) Assume you have 1 node cluster and default kibana indices are having 0 replicas because kibana indices are configures with a settings called "auto_expand_replicas with value of 0-1" when a new node is available
16) Replication ensures that if a node goes down, data will be available on a different node (provided that the cluster consists of more than one node).
17) By default for a newly created index 2 shards are created (1 primary shard + 1 replica shard)


Snapshots:
1) Elasticsearch supports taking backups as snapshots to restore data
2) Snapshot can be used to restore to a given point in time
3) Snapshots can be taken at index level or for entire cluster
4) Use snapshots for daily backups and replication for high availability and performance

Node Roles:
1) Data in indices are stored in shards and shards are stored in nodes based on the roles of the node
2) you can find the node role in the nodes apis where node.role column tells (dim stands for data,ingest,master)
Mater Role:
1) A Node can be elected as master node by voting process
2) Configuration node.master=true|false can be given to multiple nodes 
3) A master node is responsible for creating/deleting indexes among others
4) A node with master role doesnt automatically becomes master node unless there are no other master nodes available

Data Role:
1) Enables a node to store data
2) Storing data includes performing search queries relates to the data
3) for smaller clusters this role is already enabled 
4) Used for having dedicated master nodes
5) Configuration: node.data=true|false

Ingest Role:
1) Enables a node to run ingest pipeline
2) Ingesting refers to adding a document to a index
3) A simplified version of LogStash functionality within elastic
4) Configuration node.ingest=true|false

Machine Learning Role:
1) node.ml identifies a node as a machine learning node, this lets node run machine learning jobs
2) Configuration: node.ml=true|false
3) Configuration: xpack.ml.enabled=true|false enables or disables the machine learning apis for the node
4) Useful for running machine learning jobs without effecting other tasks

Coordination Role:
1) Coordination refers to the distrubution of queries and aggregate results
2) Configuration need for this role -> node.master=false, node.data=false, node.ml=false, node.ingest=false, xpack.ml.enabled=false
3) this role is configured by disabling all other nodes
4) useful for coordination when you have large clusters

Voting-only Role:
1) Rarely used, you wont use it either
2) Configuration node.voting-only=true|false
3) A node with this role will participate in voting the new master node, but cannot be elected for master node

When to change node roles:
1) Typically used for large cluster
2) When optimizing cluster to scale the no of requests
3) Better understanding what hardware resources are used for
4) Only change the roles when you have clear idea what you are doing
